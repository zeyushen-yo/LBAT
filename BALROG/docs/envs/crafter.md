# Crafter

Crafter is an open-source 2D survival game
designed specifically for research on strong generalization, deep
exploration, and long-term reasoning in reinforcement learning. It is a
Minecraft-inspired, procedurally generated environment that combines
resource gathering, crafting, and combat elements. Additionally, the
game includes a comprehensive set of tasks and achievements, enabling
researchers to evaluate agent performance across multiple objectives and
time scales. To enable interaction with language models we use the same
language wrapper as proposed in @wu2023smartplay.
